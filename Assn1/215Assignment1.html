                    Based on his longrunning book series, George R.R. Martin's "Game Of Thrones" is a cocktail of high-fantasy, action, political drama, and romance. Encompassed in a three arc narrative is hundreds of hours of world building and character development that few other series have brought so well to film. Fans of the book series may note that the show diverges from the books, and becomes its own beast as it progresses. A single paragraph describing the show cannot do it justice; it is absolutely a must see.

                    Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric search for the Philsopher's Stone, in hoping of restoreing their bodies, which were lost when they committed a taboo with their alchemy trying to resurrect their deceased mother. Edward, who lost his right arm and left leg, joins the State Military, which gives him the freedom to continue the search as he tries to restore his brother's body, whose soul is tethered to earth by a suit of armor. However, the brothers are not the only ones seeking Philosopher's Stone. As they search, they learn of a plot to transmute the entire country for reasons they do not know.

                    Black Mirror is comprised of several standalone stories, and while never directly intersect with one another, tell an overarching cautionary tale of the consiquences of modern technology. Taking a very "Twilight-Zone" approach to storytelling, each episode takes a detailed and, sometimes, disturbing examination of any one aspect of futuristic technology that we may very well have in our hands in the near future. Despite starting off on a very rocky note (the pilot episode is somewhat in poor taste), Black Mirror becomes one of the best examples of modern science fiction done right.

                    House M.D. follows the titular character, Head of Medical Diagnosis at Princeton Plainsboro Hospital, through a series of increasingly bizarre medical mysteries. Very often related to Sherlock Holmes, Dr. House uses his cynical wit, intuition, and often-morally questionable skills to save the various lives of patients who come to him. With a well developed supporting cast, dark humor, and surprisingly deep insights on drug addiction and medical ethics, House M.D. has earned its place on the small screen.

                    A spinoff of the popular Cheers T.V. series, Fraiser follows Dr. Fraiser Crane through his move to Seattle and job as a radio-personality / psychaitrist. As he is adjusting to his new lifestyle (as well as having his father live with him and rocky relations with his brother), Fraiser works through a series of what many would call mundane situations, almost always going arwy thanks to his hubris. Recently rewatching this series as an adult made me realise not just how much of the humor went over my head as a kid, but how much genuine humor and parallels with the modern american lifestyle is tightly packed into this show, hence my recommendation.

                    A spinoff of the "Buffy the Vampire" series, Angel follows the titular vampire leaving Sunnydale, CA and into Los Angeles to attone for centuries of murder and evil. He is soon approached by a demon sent by the Powers-That-Be, on a mission to assist Angel against an onslaught of demons, while trying to help maintain his humanity. They are soon joined by familiar faces from the past, forming a detective agency for the peculiar and bizarre. Notably darker (and on occasion, goofier) than its parent series, Angel takes elements of traditional fiml-noir and fits them to the modern screen, and does so exceptionally well.
